## 11.1 Introduction

Consider an organization that provides a Website that allows its customers to view their products. The company has received frequent customer feedbacks to provide the shopping facility online. Therefore, the company has decided to add the shopping facility in their Website by creating dynamic Web pages. These Web pages will allow the user to shop for the products online. For example, details such as credit card number, email, and phone number entered by the customer must be in a proper format. Further, the developer also requires to retrieve the chosen products and their quantity to calculate the total cost.

The developer can handle all these critical tasks by using a scripting language. A scripting language refers to a set of instructions that provides some functionality when the user interacts with a Web page.

## 11.2 Scripting

Scripting refers to a series of commands that are interpreted and executed sequentially and immediately on occurrence of an event. This event is an action generated by a user while interacting with a Web page. Examples of events include button clicks, selecting a product from a menu, and so on. Scripting languages are often embedded in the HTML pages to change the behaviour of the Web pages according to the user’s requirements.

There are two types of scripting languages, described as follows:

* **Client-side Scripting**

  * Refers to a script being executed on the client’s machine by the browser.
* **Server-side Scripting**

  * Refers to a script being executed on a Web server to generate dynamic HTML pages.

## 11.3 JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to build dynamic Web pages by ensuring maximum user interactivity. JavaScript language is an object-based language, which means that it provides objects for specifying functionalities. In real life, an object is a visible entity such as a car or a table. Every object has some characteristics and is capable of performing certain actions. Similarly, in a scripting language, an object has a unique identity, state, and behaviour.

The identity of the object distinguishes it from the other objects of the same type. The state of the object refers to its characteristics, whereas the behavior of the object consists of its possible actions. The object stores its identity and state in fields (also called variables) and exposes its behaviour through functions (actions).

| **Car**                           | **Table**              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Identity**: BMW F90 M5          | **Identity**: T002     |
| **State**: Color-Red, Wheels-Four | **State**: Color-Brown |
| **Behavior**: Running             | **Behavior**: Stable   |

## 11.4 Versions of JavaScript

The first version of JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 and was named JavaScript 1.0. Netscape Navigator 1.0 and Internet Explorer 3.0 supported JavaScript 1.0. Over the period, it gradually evolved with newer versions where each version provided better features and functionalities as compared to their previous versions.

Table 11.1 lists various versions of JavaScript language, also called as ECMAScript.

| **Edition** | **Name**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                             |

## 11.5 Client-side JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language, which can be executed on the client-side and on the server-side. A client-side JavaScript (CSJS) is executed by the browser on the user’s workstation. A client-side script might contain instructions for the browser to handle user interactivity. These instructions might be to change the look or content of a Web page based on the user inputs. Examples include displaying a welcome page with the username, displaying date and time, validating that the required user details are filled, and so on.

A JavaScript is either embedded in an HTML page or is separately defined in a file, which is saved with a `.js` extension. In client-side scripting, when an HTML page is requested, the Web server sends all the required files to the user’s computer. The Web browser executes the script and displays the HTML page to the user along with any tangible output of the script.

---

## 11.6 Server-side JavaScript

A server-side JavaScript (SSJS) is executed by the Web server when an HTML page is requested by a user. The output of a server-side JavaScript is sent to the user and is displayed by the browser. In this case, a user might not be aware that a script was executed on the server to produce the desirable output.

A server-side JavaScript can interact with the database, fetch the required information specific to the user, and display it to the user. This means that server-side scripting fulfills the goal of providing dynamic content in a web page. Unlike client-side JavaScript, HTML pages using server-side JavaScript are compiled into bytecode files on the server. Compilation is a process of converting the code into machine-independent code. This machine-independent code is known as the bytecode, which is an executable file. The Web server runs this executable to generate the desired output.

---

## 11.7 Script Tag
The `<script>` tag defines a script for an HTML page to make them interactive. The browser that supports scripts interprets and executes the script specified under the `<script>` tag when the page loads in the browser. You can directly insert a JavaScript code under the `<script>` tag. You can define multiple `<script>` tags either in the `<head>` or in the `<body>` elements of an HTML page. In HTML5, the type attribute `type="text/javascript"` specifying the scripting language is no longer required as it is optional.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Document</title>
		<script>
			document.write("Hello World!");
		</script>
	</head>
<body>
	...
</body>
</html>
```

There are two main purpose of the `<script>` tag, which are as follows:
- Identifies a given segment of script in the HTML page.
- Loads an external script file.

## 11.8 Variables in JavaScript
A variable refers to a symbolic name that holds a value, which keeps changing. For example, age of a student and salary of an employee can be treated as variables. A real-life example for variables includes the variables used in algebraic expressions that store values.

In JavaScript, a variable is a unique location in the computer's memory that stores a value and has a unique name. The name of the variable is used to access and read the value stored in it. A variable can store different types of data such as a character, a number, or a string. Therefore, a variable acts as container for saving and changing values during execution of the script.

## 11.8.1 Declaring Variables
Declaring a variable refers to creating a variable by specifying the variable name. For example, you can create a variable named `studName` to store the name of a student. Here, the variable name `studName` is referred to as a identifier. In JavaScript, the var keyword is used to create a variable by allocating memory to it. A keyword is a reserved word that holds a special meaning in JavaScript.

You can initialize the variable at the time of creating the variable or later. Initilization refers to the task of assigning a value to a variable. once the variable is initialized, you can change the value of a variable as required.

Variables allow keeping track of data during the execution of the script. While referring to a variable, you are referring to the value of that variable. In JavaScript, you can declare and initialize multiple variables in a single statement.

Following syntax demonstrates how to declare variables in JavaScript:
**Syntax**
```
var <variableName>;
```
where,
```
var: Is the keyword in JavaScript
variableName: Is a valid variable name.
```

Following syntax demonstrates how to initalize variables in JavaScript:
**Syntax**
```
<variableName> = <value>;
```
where,
= : Is the assignment operator used to assign values.
value: Is the data that is to be stored in the variable.

Following syntax demonstrates how to declare and initialize multiple variables in a single statement, which are separated by commas.
**Syntax**
```
var <variableName> = <value>, <variableName2> = <value2>;
```

Code Snippet 2 declares two variables namely, `studID` and `studName` and assign values to them.
**Code Snippet 2**
```
var studID;
var studName;
studID = 50;
studName = "Abdullah";
```

This code assigns values to `studID` and `studName` variables by using the assignment operator `=`. The value named `Abdullah` is specified within double quotes.

Code Snippet 3 demonstrates how to declare and initialize multiple variables in a single statement in JavaScript.

**Code Snippet 3**
`var studName = 'Abdullah', studAge = 15;`

## Understanding `var`, `let`, and `const`

## 3.2 The var Keyword

### 3.2.1 Definition

The **var** keyword is the original method for declaring variables in JavaScript. It has been part of the language since 1995.

### 3.2.2 Key Characteristics

**Function Scope:** Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared, regardless of block boundaries.

**Re-declaration Allowed:** The same variable can be declared multiple times within the same scope without generating an error.

**Re-assignment Allowed:** Values can be changed after declaration.

**Hoisting:** Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope. The declaration is processed before code execution, but initialization remains in place.

**Note:** Modern JavaScript development discourages the use of var due to scope-related issues.

---
## 3.3 The let Keyword

### 3.3.1 Definition

The **let** keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015 to address the shortcomings of var. It provides block-level scope.

### 3.3.2 Key Characteristics

**Block Scope:** Variables declared with let are block-scoped. They only exist within the block (defined by curly braces) in which they are declared.

**No Re-declaration:** Unlike var, let does not allow re-declaration of the same variable within the same scope.

**Re-assignment Allowed:** Values can be changed after declaration.

**Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ):** Variables declared with let cannot be accessed before their declaration in the code.

**Usage:** Use let when you need to declare a variable whose value will change during program execution, such as loop counters or accumulator variables.

---

## 3.4 The const Keyword

### 3.4.1 Definition

The **const** keyword, also introduced in ES6, is used to declare constants—variables whose binding cannot be changed after initialization.

### 3.4.2 Key Characteristics

**Block Scope:** Like let, const is block-scoped and only accessible within its defining block.

**No Re-declaration:** Cannot declare the same variable twice within the same scope.

**No Re-assignment:** Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned. The binding between the variable name and its value is constant.

**Must Initialize:** Constants must be initialized at the time of declaration. Declaration without initialization results in an error.

**Object and Array Mutability:** While the binding of a const variable cannot change, the contents of objects and arrays declared with const can be modified. You can add, remove, or change properties of objects and elements of arrays.

**Usage:** Use const as the default choice for variable declaration. It should be used for values that will not be reassigned, including configuration values, mathematical constants, and references to objects and arrays.

---
## 3.5 Comparison Table

|Feature|var|let|const|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Scope**|Function|Block|Block|
|**Re-declaration**|Allowed|Not Allowed|Not Allowed|
|**Re-assignment**|Allowed|Allowed|Not Allowed|
|**Must Initialize**|No|No|Yes|
|**Hoisting**|Yes (undefined)|Yes (TDZ)|Yes (TDZ)|
|**Modern Usage**|Avoid|When value changes|Default choice|

## 11.8.2 Variable Naming Rules
You cannot refer to a variable until it is created in JavaScript. JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that if you specify `X` and `x` as variables, both of them are treated as two different variables. Similarly, in JavaScript, there are certain rules, which must be followed while specifying variables names. These rules for a variable name are as follows:

- Can consist of digits, underscore, and alphabets.
- Must begin with a letter or the underscore character.
- Cannot begin with a number and cannot contain any punctuation marks.
- Cannot contain any kind of special characters such as `+`, `*`, `%` and so on.
- Cannot contain spaces.
- Cannot be a JavaScript keyword.

It is recommended to give meaningful names to variables such that the name determines the kind of data stored in the variable.

## 11.9 Data Types in JavaScript
A Web page designer can store different types of values such as numbers, characters, or strings in variables. However, the Web page designer must know what kind of data a particular variable is expected to store. To identify the type of data that can be stored in a variable , JavaScript provides different data types.

A Web page designer is not required to specify the data type while declaring variables. Due to this, JavaScript is referred to as the loosely typed language. This means that a variable holding a number can also hold a string value later. The values of variables are automatically mapped to their data types when the script is executed in the browser.

Data types in JavaScript are classified into two broad categories namely, primitive and composite data types. Primitive data types contain only a single value, whereas the composite data types contain a group values.

## 11.9.1 Primitive Data Types
A primitive data type contains a single literal value such as number or a string. A literal is a static value that you can assign to variables.

| Primitive Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `boolean`           | Contains only two values namely, true or false.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `null`              | Contains only one value namely, null. A variable of this value specifies that the variable has no value. This null value is keyword and it is not the same as the value, zero                                                                  |
| `number`            | Contains positive and negative numbers and numbers with decimal point. Some of the valid examples include 6, 7.5, -8, 7.5e-3 and so on.                                                                                                        |
| `string`            | Contains alphanumeric characters in single or double quotation marks. The single quotes is used to represent a string, which itself consists of quotation marks. A set of quotes without any characters within it is known as the null string. |
## 11.9.2 Composite Data Types
A composite data type stores a collection of multiple related values, unlike primitive data types. In JavaScript, all composite data types are treated as objects. A composite data type can be either predefined or user-defined in JavaScript.

| Data Types | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objects    | Refers to a collection of properties and functions. Properties specify the characteristics and functions determine the behavior of a JavaScript object. |
| Functions  | Refers to a collection of statements, which are instructions to achieve a specific task                                                                 |
| Arrays     | Refers to a collection of values stored in a adjacent memory locations.                                                                                 |

## Escape Sequence Characters
An escape sequence character is a special character that is preceded by a backslash `(\)`. Escape sequence characters are used to display special non-printing characters such as a tab space, a single space, or a backspace. These non-printing characters help in displaying formatted output to the user to maximize readability. The backslash character specifies that the following character denotes a non-printing character. For example, `\t` is an escape sequence characters must always be enclosed in double quotes.

| Escape Sequence | Non-Printing Character                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\b`            | Back space                                                                                                                                                  |
| `\f`            | Form feed                                                                                                                                                   |
| `\n`            | New line                                                                                                                                                    |
| `\r`            | Carriage return                                                                                                                                             |
| `\t`            | Horizontal tab                                                                                                                                              |
| `\'`            | Single quote                                                                                                                                                |
| `\"`            | Double quote                                                                                                                                                |
| `\\`            | Backslash                                                                                                                                                   |
| `\aaa`          | Matches a Latin-1 encoding character using octal representation, where aaa are three octal numbers. For example, \251 represents the copyright symbol.      |
| `\xaa`          | Matches a Latin-1 encoding character using hexadecimal representation, where aa are two hexadecimal numbers. For example, \x61 represents the character 'a' |
| `\uaaaa`        | Represents the Unicode encoding character, where aaaa are four hexadecimal numbers. For example, the character \u0020 represents a space.                   |
```
<script>
	document.write("You must have a \u0022credit card\u0022, if you want to shop     on the \'Internet\'.");
</script>
```
The code uses a Unicode encoding character namely, `\u00022`, which represents double quotes. These open and close double quotes will contain the term `credit card`. Similarly, the word `Internet` will be placed in single quotes. The single quotes are specified using the backslash character.

> NOTE - An encoding scheme specifies how to represent character data in terms of their acceptable range, maximum number of characters, and patterns. Unicode is a character set that contains all the international characters required for processing information. Latin 1 is the encoding scheme for English and Western European languages on the Internet.

## 11.13 Built-in Functions
A function is a piece of code that performs some operations on variables to fulfill a specific task. It takes one or more input values, processes them, and returns an output value. JavaScript provides built-in functions that are already defined to fulfill a certain task. Table 11.5 lists the built-in functions.

| Function       | Description                                                                                                       | Example                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alert()`      | Displays a dialog box with some information and OK button                                                         | `alert("Please fill all fields of the form");` Displays a message box with the instruction      |
| `confirm()`    | Displays a dialog box with OK and Cancel buttons. It verifies an action, which a user wants to perform            | `confirm("Are you sure you want to close the page?")`; Displays a message box with the question |
| `parseInt()`   | Converts a string value into a numeric value                                                                      | `parseInt("25 years");`                                                                         |
| `parseFloat()` | Converts a string value into a number with decimal point                                                          | `parseFloat("10.33");` Returns 10.33                                                            |
| `eval()`       | Evaluates an expression and returns the evaluated result                                                          | `eval("2+2");` Returns 4                                                                        |
| `isNaN`        | Checks whether a value is not a number                                                                            | `isNaN("Hello");` Returns true                                                                  |
| `prompt()`     | Displays a dialog box that accepts an input value through a text box. It also accepts default value for text box. | `prompt("Enter your name", "Name");` Displays message in dialog box and Name in text box.       |
> **NOTE** - The `\n` character, when used in the `alert()` function, prints the information on a new line. This does not happen when the `\n` character is used with the `write` methods of the `document` object.

# Operators – Introduction

In JavaScript, **operators** are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables. They help in executing tasks such as calculations, assignments, comparisons, and logical decision-making. Most standard programming books categorize JavaScript operators into four primary groups, which are explained below.

## **1. Arithmetic Operators**

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations on numbers. They allow you to create numeric expressions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

**Common Arithmetic Operators:**

* `+` (Addition)

* `-` (Subtraction)

* `*` (Multiplication)

* `/` (Division)

* `%` (Modulus – returns remainder)

* `**` (Exponentiation – power)

* `++` (Increment)

* `--` (Decrement)

These operators are essential for performing calculations and manipulating numeric data in programs.

---

## **2. Assignment Operators**

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also combine assignment with another operation, allowing concise and readable code.

**Common Assignment Operators:**

* `=` (Simple Assignment)

* `+=` (Add and assign)

* `-=` (Subtract and assign)

* `*=` (Multiply and assign)

* `/=` (Divide and assign)

* `%=` (Modulus and assign)

* `**=` (Exponent and assign)

Programming books often refer to these as “shorthand assignment operators” because they simplify expressions.

---
## 3. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values and return a **boolean result** (`true` or `false`).
These operators are widely used in decision-making constructs such as `if`, `else`, and loops.

**Common Comparison Operators:**

* `==` (Equal to – compares values)

* `===` (Strict equal to – compares value and type)

* `!=` (Not equal to)

* `!==` (Strict not equal to)

* `>` (Greater than)

* `<` (Less than)

* `>=` (Greater than or equal to)

* `<=` (Less than or equal to)

---
## **4. Logical Operators**

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions or to apply logical reasoning in a program.

They operate on boolean values and return either `true` or `false`.

**Common Logical Operators:**

* `&&` (Logical AND) — returns true only if all conditions are true

* `||` (Logical OR) — returns true if at least one condition is true

* `!` (Logical NOT) — reverses a boolean value (`true` becomes `false` and vice versa)

These operators play a key role in controlling the flow of a program.

## 11.14 Events
Consider a scenario where you want to design an Employee registration Web form. This form allows the users to fill in appropriate details and click the submit button. When the user clicks the submit button, the form data is submitted to the server for validation purposes. In this case, when the user clicks the button, and event is generated. The submission of form refers to the action performed on click of the button.

An event occurs when a user interacts with the Web page. Some of the commonly generated events are mouse click, key strokes, and so on. The process of handling these events is known as event handling.

## 11.14.1 Event Handling
Event handling is a process of specifying actions to be performed when an event occurs. This is done by using an event handler. An event handler is a scripting code or a function that defines the actions to be performed when the event is triggered.

When an event occurs, an event handler function that is associated with the specific event is invoked. The information about this generated event is updated on the `event` object. The `event` object is a built-in object, which can be accessed through the `window` object.

It specifies the event state, which includes information such as the location of mouse cursor, element on which event occurred, and state of the keys in a keyboard.

## 11.14.2 Event Bubbling
Event bubbling is mechanism that allows you to specify a common event handler for all child elements. This means that the parent element handles all the events generated by the child elements. For example, consider a Web page that consists of a paragraph and a table. The paragraph consists of multiple occurrences of italic text. Now, you want to change the color of each italic text of a paragraph when the user clicks a particular button. Instead of declaring an event handler for each italic text, you can declare it within the P element. This allows you to apply colors for all italic text within the paragraph. This helps in reducing the development time and efforts since it minimizes the code.

![Figure 11.11: Event Bubbling](./images/EventBubbling.drawio.png)

## 11.14.3 Life Cycle of on Event
An event's life starts when the user preforms an action to interact with the Web page. It finally ends when the event handler provides a response to the user's action.

Steps involved in the life cycle of an event are as follows:
- The user performs an action to raise an event.
- The event object is updated to determine the event state.
- The event is fired.
- The event bubbling occurs as the event bubbles through the elements of the hierarchy.
- The event handler is invoked that performs the specified actions.

## 11.14.4 Keyboard Events
Keyboard events are the events that occur when a key or a combination of keys are pressed or released from a keyboard. These events occur for all keys of a keyboard.

Different keyboard events are as follows:
- **Onkeydown**
	- Occurs when a key is pressed down.
- **Onkeyup**
	- Occurs when the key is released.
- **Onkeypress**
	- Occurs when a key is pressed and released.

## Mouse Events
Mouse events occur when the user clicks the mouse button.

| Events        | Description                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `onmousedown` | Occurs when the button is pressed.                                 |
| `onmouseup`   | Occurs when the mouse button is released.                          |
| `onclick`     | Occurs when the mouse button is pressed and released.              |
| `ondbclick`   | Occurs when the mouse button is double-clicked.                    |
| `onmousemove` | Occurs when the mouse pointer is moved from one location to other. |
| `onmouseover` | Occurs when the mouse pointer is moved over the element.           |
| `onmouseout`  | Occurs when the mouse pointer is moved out of the element.         |
## Focus and Selection Events
The focus events determine the activation of various elements that uses the `input` element. It allows you to set or reset focus for different `input` elements. The selection events occur when an element or a part of an element within a Web page is selected.

| Events          | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `onfocus`       | Occurs when an element receives focus.          |
| `onblur`        | Occurs when an element loses focus.             |
| `onselectstart` | Occurs when the selection of an element starts. |
| `onselect`      | Occurs when the present selection changes.      |
| `ondragstart`   | Occurs when the selected element is moved.      |
## 11.18.2 Increment and Decrement Operators
The increment and decrement operators are unary operators, as they operate only on a single operand. The increment operator `(++)` increases the value by 1, while the decrement operator `(--)` decreases the value by 1. These operators can be placed either before or after the operand. If the operator is placed before the operand, the expression is called pre-increment or pre-decrement. If the operator is placed after the operand, the expression is called post-increment or post-decrement.

| Expression           | Type           | Result       |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| `numTwo = ++numOne;` | Pre-increment  | `numTwo = 3` |
| `numTwo = numOne++;` | Post-increment | `numTwo = 2` |
| `numTwo = --numOne;` | Pre-decrement  | `numTwo = 1` |
| `numTwo = numOne--;` | Post-decrement | `numTwo = 2` |
```
<script>
	var number = 3;
	console.log('Number after increment = ' + ++number);
	console.log('Number after decrement = ' + number--);
</script>
```
The first `console.log()` function will display the incremented value of the `number` variable. This is because the first statement, `++` operator is evaluated first and then, the incremented value is substituted in the variable `number`. The second `console.log()` function will not display the decremented value of the `number` variable. This is because the current value is first assigned to the variable, and then, the --operator is evaluated.

## Loops
In the world of programming, loops are the engines of automation. They allow a script to repeat a specific set of instructions multiple times without the need to write the same logic over and over again. Think of a loop as a circular track: as long as a certain condition remains true, the runner (the code) keeps circling. The moment the condition is no longer met, the runner exits the track and moves on.

In JavaScript, there are three fundamental types of loops used to control this flow: `for`, `while`, and `do...while`.

---
### 1. The `for` Loop: The Controlled Marathon

The `for` loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to run a task. It is highly structured and keeps all the "logistics"—where to start, when to stop, and how to change—in one single line.

**The Syntax:**

`for (initialization; condition; afterthought)`

* **Initialization:** Where you set your starting point (e.g., "Start at 1").

* **Condition:** The rule that must stay true for the loop to continue (e.g., "Keep going as long as the number is less than 10").

* **Afterthought:** How you update your progress after every lap (e.g., "Add 1 to the number").
### 2. The `while` Loop: The Open-Ended Journey

The `while` loop is more flexible. It is used when you don't necessarily know how many repetitions are needed beforehand; you just know that the code should keep running as long as a specific condition is met. It checks the "gate" before every single lap. If the gate is closed (the condition is false) before the loop even starts, the code inside will never run.

**The Syntax:**

`while (condition)`

* **Condition:** A simple true/false check. If it evaluates to true, the loop runs. If it’s false, the loop stops immediately.

### 3. The `do...while` Loop: The Guaranteed Start

The `do...while` loop is a variation of the `while` loop, with one critical difference: it executes its task **first** and checks the condition **second**. This ensures that the code inside the loop runs at least once, even if the condition is false from the very beginning. It’s like a "shoot first, ask questions later" approach.

**The Syntax:**

`do { ... } while (condition);`

* **The "Do" block:** The task that will be executed at least one time.

* **Condition:** Checked after the task is finished to see if it should repeat.

### JavaScript Loop Comparison

|**Feature**|**for Loop**|**while Loop**|**do...while Loop**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Best Used When...**|You know the **exact number** of times to repeat.|The number of repeats is **unknown** or dynamic.|You need the code to run **at least once**.|
|**Logic Location**|Initialization, condition, and update are in **one line**.|Only the condition is defined in the loop header.|The condition is defined at the very end.|
|**Check Timing**|**Pre-test:** Checks the condition before every lap.|**Pre-test:** Checks the condition before every lap.|**Post-test:** Checks the condition _after_ the lap.|
|**Minimum Runs**|**0** (If the condition is false, it never starts).|**0** (If the condition is false, it never starts).|**1** (Even if the condition is false).|
|**Complexity**|Best for counters and fixed ranges.|Best for "waiting" for a specific state change.|Best for menu displays or input validation.|

Pro Tip
> [!TIP]
> 
> Which one should I choose?
> 
> Always start with a for loop if you are counting. Use a while loop if you are waiting for something to happen (like a user clicking a button or a file finishing a download). Only use do...while if the action must happen once before you even check if it should happen again.
